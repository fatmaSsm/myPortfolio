Hey! I’m Fatma 👋  
I’m an Information Systems Engineering student with a strong interest in building interactive, meaningful digital experiences.

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my projects, experiments, and the areas I’m currently exploring.

## ✨ About Me

- 🎓 Information Systems Engineering student at Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University  
- 💻 Background in Software Development (vocational high school)  
- 🌱 Constantly learning through Udemy courses, bootcamps, and hands-on workshops  
- 🎮 Curious about game development, interactive systems, and creative coding  
- 🧠 Interested in backend logic, data, systems, and security fundamentals  

I value **clean, readable code**, **strong visual identity**, and **thoughtful user interactions** over purely static designs.
